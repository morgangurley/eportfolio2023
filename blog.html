  <p><strong>How to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Correctly </span>Explore the Whitsundays&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Regrets Make the Best Motivation</strong></p>
<p><span>Most people have most likely never heard of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Whitsunday Islands</span>, but I’m here to tell you about my experience on a four-day trip that I will never forget. It begins almost a full year before the trip. I had been planning my whole life to go abroad to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Australia</span>, but as the trip was approaching quicker and quicker, my cousin, who had also studied abroad in Australia, sat me down at Christmas dinner and explained all the must see places and experiences. One thing that stood out to me was his biggest regret of his time there. Not going with a group of his friends to the Whitsunday Islands. I immediately looked up a photo of this supposed promise land and knew I had to make it happen. Fast forward a year later and after 32 hours of travel I was thrown into a group of 36 other Americans studying at the same university as me. Although the first few days were plagued with jet lag, we were also given the opportunity to cross many things off our bucket lists. After scuba diving on the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Great Barrier reef </span>and skydiving above the mountainous Cairns city, it was time to buckle back into a plane and finally see our new home for the next 4 months.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The next few weeks were focused on getting acquainted with the new campus, culture, and finding friends with similar travel ambitions. Finally, after being as settled in as possible, a group of us sat down in the library planning to do homework, but soon got sidetracked dreaming of different trip itineraries and how to make the most of our 4 months in this new country. This is when I proposed the Whitsunday Islands. Not just a trip there, but a 3 day sailing trip throughout the crystal clear waters. After lots of planning around exams and class schedules, we booked the trip and waited with excitement for the day to come.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 1: The Learning Curve</strong></p>
<p><span>Bright and early on a Thursday morning, my 6 friends and I quickly shleped to the uber to take us to the airport. After a quick 2 and a half hour plane ride, we landed, excited for the adventure before us. Our first challenge was getting to our hotel for the night and after about 30 minutes waiting for someone's uber app to work, a local finally gave us the news that there actually weren’t any ubers in the small town of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Airlie Beach</span>. Finally, we flagged down a cab and took the ride into the town crossing fields of cows, spotting <span style="text-decoration: underline;">kangaroos</span>, and being warned of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">saltwater crocodiles</span> that lurk in the surrounding waters. Once we had finally made it to the hotel and checked in, it was time to get ready for our night out in the quaint town of Airlie, which we quickly found out was not as quiet as one might think. Wandering around the main street, we found ourselves popping into each local restaurant for a quick drink or a bite to eat and found ourselves talking to locals about the best place to be. Instantly we found out we were in the wrong spot and everyone our age was at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Buoys</span>. Quickly, we finished our drinks and headed to this local hotspot. To our surprise, the town actually wasn’t empty, we had just been in the wrong place and Thursday night is karaoke night. We instantly knew our role as the group of “loud americans” and got our place in line to sing a classic.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Party in the USA </span>blared as we grabbed our microphones and 50 other twenty-somethings sang along to Miley Cyrus. As the night came to a close, we grabbed a cab and a quick chicken nugget meal from “Maccas” (this is what Australians call McDonalds) and headed home for the night anxiously awaiting the next day where we would board the Atlantic Clipper and set off for 3 life changing days.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 2: Bring it on&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span>Our journey began with excitement and a hint of disappointment as it began to pour down rain when we headed to the docks off of Airlie beach. Pickup time was listed from 11 to 2 pm. Foolishly, us Americans figured we would get there on time, at 11. This would allow us to get acquainted with the boat, the staff, and our rooms, but we had forgotten that Australia doesn’t run quite like the US does. After 4 hours of waiting, we finally boarded the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Atlantic Clipper</span> with about 50 other 20 year olds backpacking throughout Australia, mostly from the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">UK.</span> Finally aboard the old Guinness transport vessel we placed our bags in our rooms which were all but glamorous and met our roommate Kate. The only problem was there were 3 beds, and 4 people. After a quick discussion on who would be sleeping where in the tiniest room I’ve ever seen, we were told the rules for the next 3 days. 2 minute showers, maximum, no shoes on board, and don’t jump in the water without a stinger suit on. For those of you who don't know, Australia has many things that can kill you, one of which being jellyfish. During a stretch of 3 months, they are everywhere. This means that each time you get into the water, a thin wetsuit like suit is required to ensure that no one is getting stung. After the rundown, we set off and began to meet the strangers we would be spending the next few days with.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When we finally reached our first destination, the staff quickly set up a water slide and we lined up to take the plunge. One by one, we dove into the water and ran back to the top to do it again. After the water activities ended, dinner was served and we spent the night chatting with new people who began to feel like old friends.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 3: Not your Average Tour&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span> </span><span>Waking up on a catamaran, gently rocked by the ocean, is a unique experience in and of itself, but the staff had other plans. At a crisp 6 am, the crew began to blare the iconic song <span style="text-decoration: underline;">“The Circle of Life”</span> from The Lion King throughout the boat leaving everyone no choice but to wake up and eat breakfast. Today was the day we would see the iconic <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Whitehaven beach</span>. A short ride later, we were tendered off the boat and embarked on our short hike to the viewpoint of the beach where <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Captain Jack Sparrow </span>ran for his life in Pirates of the Caribbean 5. After taking in the scenic views, we went down to the beach and relaxed in the water among lemon sharks and stingrays until it was time to hike back to the pickup location. After getting back on the boat, we set sail again heading to a tiny inlet where we were free to snorkel or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">scuba dive</span> in the pristine waters and enjoy all that the ocean has to offer us.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span> </span><span>As the water activities came to an end, we moved into a sheltered bay and bargained for who would shower first since there were only 2 showers on board. After finally getting clean, we all changed into our white outfits for the white party and headed out to enjoy the amazing views of the sunset. Dinner was served as we all chatted about our favorite memories of the day. As dinner came to an end, the crew moved everyone up to the top deck and split everyone into teams. We played games and danced the night away under the stars.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Day 4: Memories that will last a Lifetime&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span> </span><span>After a long night making memories and new friends, the boat was quiet as we all slept peacefully in our bunk. That is until the crew blasted Will Ferrell's rendition of “</span><span>Por Ti Volare '' from the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step Brothers </span>movie throughout all the cabins once again at 6 am. As we headed up to breakfast the staff ensured us that it was to make the most out of our final few hours on board. We headed up to the top deck to enjoy our toast and cereal where to our surprise, there was a massive<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> inflatable slide</span> into the water as well as paddle boards and a floating mat for us all to enjoy after eating. We hustled down to our cabins, threw on our bathing suits and stinger suits and promptly threw ourselves off the top deck into the water, forgetting that the sun had only just risen. Back and forth between lounging on the floating mat, to down the slide, to jumping off the boat, we watched as the skies opened up above us and poured down rain. Not allowing the rain to stop our fun, we kept up with our activities as a rainbow formed behind us. Finally, the crew made the announcement that it was time to head back and provided the most delicious <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hotdogs </span>I have ever had, at 9 am.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span> </span><span>We sadly disembarked the Atlantic Clipper </span><span>with our hearts full from the breathtaking beauty of the Whitsundays and with a new extended family of f<span style="text-decoration: underline;">riends from across the globe.</span> What made this trip truly unique was the presence of the 40 strangers from all around Europe who became friends along the way.</span><span> </span><span>The Whitsunday Islands and the sailing experience brought us all together, uniting us in our shared love for travel, exploration, and fun. I will never forget the bonds I created and memories I shared with a crew of strangers and friends alike. This trip has forever changed me and reminded me how important it is to get <span style="text-decoration: underline;">lost in an experience</span> and feel like a kid again. Although there were many bumps along the way, as there always is with travel, I wouldn’t have had it any other way and I encourage anyone and everyone to take this trip.&nbsp;</span></p>
